# Hackintosh-HP-Z420-Z620-Z820-OpenCore (0.7.1)

This is my OC 0.7.1 setup for HP Z420/620/820 workstations. It supports all three HP models. Tested for latest Catalina and Big Sur.

**Catalina 10.15.7** - Everthing works, except Sleep mode and some minor issue with USB3. On-board audio with AppleALC, full CPU Power Management. USB3 at full speed for attached storage device. Other USB3 attaching perepherals, however, is a hit-or-miss (leaving device connected during booting may help).

**Big Sur 11.5.2 (Update: 9/2/2021)**- Similar to Catalina, but USB3 ports is practically non-funcional. Also, CPU Power Management is not working with Sandy-Bridge CPUs (V1 version of Xeons). In this case, you need to disable loading SSDT_CPUPM.aml, until new pacthes are available. There is no issue, however, for Ivy-Bridge CPUs (V2 version of Xeons). In fact, my testing showed no patching is needed for Apple CPU Power Management (Kernal patch #7 & #8 below are not required). Leaving the two patches in config.plist does not appear to do any harm under Big Sur. So you could remove them, or leave in there if you want dual booting Catalina. For USB3 replacement, you could add a PCI-E card with internal 20-pin header, such as ones based on VLI chip with built-in macOS support (pletty on eBay for ~$13).

**Pre/Post-install:** 

Pre-Install: Add your own the Serial # & Board Info. I have removed the anonymous # for the safety reason.
Post-Install: For full CPU power management, replace "SSDT-CPUPM.aml" (in ACPI folder) with one matching your CPU model. I have provided a few from my systems. Simply overwrite "SSDT-CPUPM.aml" file with an appropriate one. If you have a different CPU from mine, you need to run **ssdtPRGen** ([link](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh)) to create a new SSDT file (bilbo's "Z820 - High Sierra, the Great Guide" ([here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335860-guide-2018-z820-high-sierra-the-great-guide-sucess/)), an excellent resource for Z820 hacking). If you have a mismatched CPU (sometimes SSDT generated from another system won't work), you might experience booting issue (such as "Memory Error" KP). In this case, simply disable SSDT-CPUPM.aml from config.plist. macOs will run just fine, without CPU power management. Once up running, you can generate a correct SSDT specific for your CPU. 

**My systems:**

- Z820/Z620/Z420Â (BIOS 3.96)
- Processors: 1620 v2, 2760 v1, 2650 v2, 2680 v2 (Single or Dual)
- SSD SATA drive or NvMe SSD on a PCI-E adapter (NvMe: SATA HD is needed to host OC loader)
- GTX 680 or Radeon 290/390X (Both are supported out of the box)

**What I did differently:**

- Hot-patching of the IRQs conflicts: TMR(0), PIC(2), RTC0(8). 
- This patch is necessary for on-board audio to work with AppleALC. With this hot fix, all key patches can be done with SSDTs, resulting in a more flexable OC loader. 


**Included in this EFI folder:**

- **OC 0.7.1** base files (debug version)
- **ACPI folder:**
	- SSDT-EC.aml		- For Embedded Controller, via OC Guide
	- SSDT-HPET.aml		- IRQ patching. Created with SDDTTimes, via OC Guide.
	- SSDT-HDEF.aml		- for Realtek ALC262 audio injection (Imported from bilbo's DSDT patch)
	- SSDT-IMEI.aml		- for IMEI (imported from bilbo's DSDT patch)
	- SSDT-OTHERS.aml	- Misc items placed in here: "SMBus" fix via OC Guide. 
	- SSDT-UIAC-ALL.aml	- USB2 port mapping for HP ZX20's (from bilbo's guide)
	
	- SSDT-CPUPM.aml	- Custom CPU SSDT for proper CPU power management. Replace this file with one that matches your CPU model (I have included a few models below). You need to create a new one if your CPU is different. bilbo's guide also has good coverage on this topic, including special instructions for 26X3 & 26X7 CPU variants.

	The following are a few CPU SSDTs I created for my systems: 
	- SSDT-2670.aml		- E5-2670 CPU, Single or Dual
	- SSDT-2650V2.aml	- E5-2650v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-2680V2.aml	- E5-2680v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-1620v2.aml	- E5-1620v2 CPU

**BIOS Setup**

Enable UEFI boot, set SATA to AHCI mode, Disable Vt-d, and enable "Legacy ACPI Tables".


Goodluck!

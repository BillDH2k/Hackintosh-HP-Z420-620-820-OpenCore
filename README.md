# Hackintosh-HP-Z420-620-820-OpenCore
**(still under construction)**. 

This is my OC 0.7.1 setup for HP Z420/620/820 workstations. Tested for Catalina (latest 10.15.7, everthing works, except Sleep Mode) and Big Sur (latest 11.5.1, except Sleep/USB3). 

This loader can be used for all three HP models. All fixes are done via hot-patching or SSDT's, thus no need for a patched DSDT, resulting in a more compatible loader. 

For **post-install:** enable full CPU power management, by enabling this CPU specific SSDT, "SSDT-CPUPM.aml", in config.plist. You will need to replace this SSDT with one that matches your CPU model. I have provided a few from my systems. You need to generate your own CPU SSDT if your have a different CPU model (read more below). Of course, you will also need to generate your own SMBIOS MacPro6,1/Serial #.

**My systems:**

- Z820/Z620/Z420Â (BIOS 3.96)
- Processors: 1620 V2, 2760 V1, 2650 V2, 2680 V2 (Single or Dual)
- SSD SATA drive or NvMe SSD on a PCI-E adapter (NvMe: SATA HD is needed to host OC loader)
- GTX 680 or Radeon 290/390X (Both are supported out of the box)
  
**Opencore/macOS:**

- OC 0.7.1
- Catalina 10.15.7 - Everything works, except Sleep. Audio via AppleALC. USB3 at full speed.
- Big Sur 11.5.1 - Same as above, except USB3 ports (storage device will not mount)

**Credits:**

- Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide ([Here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/))
- bilbo's "Z820 - High Sierra, the Great Guide" ([here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335860-guide-2018-z820-high-sierra-the-great-guide-sucess/)), and many of the follow-up contributions in the same forum. My build would be be possible without those guy's work.

**What I have done:**

- Hot-patching of the IRQs conflicts: TMR(0), PIC(2), RTC0(8). 
- This fix is required for on-board audio to work with AppleALC. Now, static DSDT patching is not necessary, and all key fixes can be done via SSDT, resulting in a loader not tied to a specific machine/BIOS/setup configuration. 


**How I did it?**

I started from a clean OC 0.7.1, followed though OC Guide for High End Desktop. Then, added additional kext and SSDT's, as well as ACPI and kernal patchings. The key content of my EFI folder is shown below. 

**Included in this EFI folder:**

- **OC 0.7.1** base files (debug version)
- **ACPI folder:**
	- SSDT-EC.aml		- For Embedded Controller, via OC Guide
	- SSDT-HPET.aml		- IRQ patching. Created with SDDTTimes, via OC Guide.
	- SSDT-HDEF.aml		- for Realtek ALC262 audio injection (Imported from bilbo's DSDT patch)
	- SSDT-IMEI.aml		- for IMEI (imported from bilbo's DSDT patch)
	- SDDT-OTHERS.aml	- Misc items placed in here: "SMBus" fix via OC Guide. 
	- SSDT-UIAC-ALL.aml	- USB2 port mapping for HP ZX20's (from bilbo's guide)
	
	- SSDT-CPUPM.aml	- Custom CPU SSDT for proper CPU power management. Currently not enabled. Replace this file with one that matches your CPU model (I have included a few modelss below). Then, enable this SSDT via config.plist (ACPI->Add, find "SDDT-CPUPM.aml" entry, change "Enabled" key to "True". Save & Reboot).

	The following are a few CPU SSDTs I created for my systems. If your CPU is not listed here, you need to create one using [ssdtPRGen](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh). bilbo's [guide](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335860-guide-2018-z820-high-sierra-the-great-guide-sucess/) also has good coverage on this topic, including special instructions for E5-26X3, 26X7 variants CPUs.
	- SSDT-2670.aml		- E5-2670 CPU, Single or Dual
	- SSDT-2650V2.aml	- E5-2650v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-2680V2.aml	- E5-2680v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-1620v2.aml	- E5-1620v2 CPU

	
- **Kexts folder:**
	- Lilu.kext
	- WhateverGreen.kext
	- AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext
	- VirtualSMC.kext
	- NVMeFix.kext						- NvMe driver (BIOS does not support direct booting. Need a Sata HD installed to host OC)
	- AstekFusion2Family.kext			- SAS controller (Z820 only. Can be removed if not needed)
	- AstekFusion2Adapter.kext			- SAS controller (Z820 only. Can be removed if not needed)
	- AppleIntelE1000e.kext				- Intel LANs (supports two ports)
	- mXHCD.kext						- Old USB3 driver, works for TI-chip under Catalina. Not fully working under Big Sur.
	- USBInjectAll.kext
	- VoodooTSCSync.kext
	- AppleALC.kext						- Audio driver
	
- ACPI Hot-Patching (config.plist - ROOT->ACPI->Patch)
	- "HPE _CRS to XCRS Rename"			- Part of the HPET IRQ fix from OC Guide
	- "TMR IRQ 0 Fix"					- Fix TMR (0) IRQ
	- "PIC IRQ 2 Fix"					- Fix PCI(2) IRQ
	- "RTC0 IRQ 8 Fix"					- Fix RTC0(8) IRQ
	- "EUSB to EH01 Rename"				- USB rename
	- "USBE to EH02 Rename"				- USB rename

- Kernal patches (config.plist - ROOT->Kernal->Patch)
	- "Apple CPU Power Management Patch #7"		- "3E7538" -> "3E9090"
	- "Apple CPU Power Management Patch #8"		- "7511B9" -> "EB11B9"
	
	
**BIOS Setup**

Enable UEFI boot, set SATA to AHCI mode, Disable Vt-d, and enable "Legacy ACPI Tables".


Goodluck!

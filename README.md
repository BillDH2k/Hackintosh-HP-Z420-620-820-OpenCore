# Hackintosh-HP-Z420-620-820-OpenCore
**(still under construction)**. 

This is my OC 0.7.1 setup for HP Z420/620/820 workstations. Test to work for latest version of Catalina (10.15.7, everthing, except Sleep Mode) and Big Sur (11.5.1, except Sleep/USB3). 

This loader can be used for all three HP models. All patchings are done via hot-patching or SSDT add-on's, thus no patching of DSDT is needed. For post-install, you may need to generate your own CPU specific SSDT to enable full CPU Power Management (Read below). Of course, you will also need to generate your own SMBIOS MacPro6,1/Serial #.

**My systems:**

- Z820/Z620/Z420Â (BIOS 3.96), Mixed CPUs: 2760 V1, 2650 V2, or 2680 V2 (Single or Dual)
- SSD SATA drive or NvMe SSD on PCI-E adapter (Need a Sata HD for hosting OC loader)
- GTX 680 or Radeon 290/390X graphics (Both are supported out of the box by macOS)
  
**Opencore/macOS:**

- OC 0.7.1
- Catalina 10.15.7 - Everything works, except Sleep. Audio via AppleALC. USB3 at full speed, for storage device.
- Big Sur 11.5.1 - Same as Catalina, except USB3 ports (storage device will not mount)

**Credits:**

- Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide ([Here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/))
- bilbo's "Z820 - High Sierra, the Great Guide" ([here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335860-guide-2018-z820-high-sierra-the-great-guide-sucess/)), and many of the follow-up contributions in the same forum. My build would be be possible without these guy's work.

**What I have done:**

- Hot-patching of the IRQs conflicts: TMR(0), PIC(2), RTC0(8). This has finally allowed me to enable the on-board audio via SSDT, and get away from using DSDT completely. The result is a working loader not tied to a static machine/bios configuration, thus more compatible for all machine models and setups.

**How I did it?**

I stated from a clean OC 0.7.1, followed though OC Guide for High End Desktop. Then, added additional kext and SSDT's. Configured config.plist to include additional ACPI and kernal patchings. The EFI folder is explained below. 

**Included in this EFI folder:**

- **OC 0.7.1** base files (debug version)
- **ACPI folder:**
	- SSDT-EC.aml		- For Embedded Controller, via OC Guide
	- SSDT-HPET.aml		- IRQ patching. Created with SDDTTimes, via OC Guide.. 
	- SSDT-HDEF.aml		- for Realtek ALC262 audio injection (Imported from bilbo's guide)
	- SSDT-IMEI.aml		- for IMEI, via OC Guide
	- SSDT-UIAC-ALL.aml	- USB2 port mapping (from bilbo's guide)
	
	- SSDT-CPUPM.aml	- Custom CPU SSDT for proper CPU power management. Created with ssdtPRGen (bilbo's guide has good information). I generated a few for my systems, listed below. Replace it (i.e. copied over) with one of the following file that matched your CPU model. Or, you could modify conifg.plist to load one of the choice following     
	
	(The following are CPU specific SSDTs for proper CPU power management. Without them, macOS will still run but without loader - rename the matching file to SSDT-CPU.aml)
	- SSDT-2670.aml		- E5-2670 CPU file, created with ssdtPRGen (bilbo's guide and the same forum have good examples)
	- SSDT-2650V2.aml	- E5-2650v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-2680V2.aml	- E5-2680v2 CPU, ...
	- SSDT-1620v2.aml	- E5-1620v2 CPU
	
- **Kexts folder:**
	- Lilu.kext
	- WhateverGreen.kext
	- AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext
	- VirtualSMC.kext
	- NVMeFix.kext						- NvMe driver (BIOS does not support direct booting. Need a Sata HD in the system to install OC)
	- AstekFusion2Family.kext			- SAS controller (Z820 only. Can be removed if not needed)
	- AstekFusion2Adapter.kext			- SAS controller (Z820 only. Can be removed if not needed)
	- AppleIntelE1000e.kext				- Intel LAN (supports two ports)
	- mXHCD.kext						- Old USB3 driver, works for TI-chip under Catalina. Not fully working for Big Sur.
	- USBInjectAll.kext					- Still needed?
	- VoodooTSCSync.kext
	- AppleALC.kext						- Audio driver
	
- ACPI Hot-Patching (config.plist - ROOT->ACPI->Patch)
	- "HPE _CRS to XCRS Rename"			- Part of the HPET IRQ fix from OC Guide
	- "TMR IRQ 0 Fix"					- Fix TMR (0) IRQ
	- "PIC IRQ 2 Fix"					- Fix PCI(2) IRQ
	- "RTC0 IRQ 8 Fix"					- Fix RTC0(8) IRQ
	- "EUSB to EH01 Rename"				- USB rename. Also required for USBInjectAll
	- "USBE to EH02 Rename"				- USB rename. Also required for USBInjectAll

- Kernal patches (config.plist - ROOT->Kernal->Patch)
	- "Apple CPU Power Management Patch #7"		- "3E7538" -> "3E9090"
	- "Apple CPU Power Management Patch #8"		- "7511B9" -> "EB11B9"
	
**BIOS Setup**

Enable UEFI boot, set SATA to AHCI mode, Disable Vt-d, and enable "Legacy ACPI Tables". You can visit bilbo's guide for additional information. In particularly,  with examples for ssdtPRGen
